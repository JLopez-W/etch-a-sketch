# Paint Box

## An Etch-a-Sketch inspired drawing grid with pen color options and a customizable number of grid squares.

Assignment from the Foundations course in The Odin Project.
The aim of this project was to demonstrate CSS, JavaScript, and DOM manipulation skills learned up to this point in the course.

### Assignment Requirements:

- A grid that allows the user to input a number that will generate a square grid, with each side being equal to the number the user entered
- A limit to the number of squares in the grid to prevent crashing
- The size of the grid is always the same, regardless of the number of grid squares inside of it
- A hover effect that changes the color of the squares when the mouse passes through the grid to create a pixelated drawing effect

### Additional Features: 
    
- Options for grids with or without grid lines
- Multiple pen color options, including a rainbow pen that uses a random color for each square with the colors used for the single-color pens
- Dropdown menu for the grid choices which include suggested options and custom size options
